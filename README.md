# Python-code
 
Both scripts can be executed with python 2.7 or 3.4 and with SO windows or Ubuntu.
"inicial.py" is the first one that I crate, not using OOP (object-oriented programming), "object.py" is the second one that I create using OOP paradigm, it uses "inicial.py" as a module in order to reuse functions and variables. 

Both scripts generate the same result in the folder "RESULTADOS_INICIAL" or "RESULTADOS_OBJECT" depending on which script do you execute:

    "base de datos inicial.txt" > Database whit the electrical power customers.
    "Lista seleccionados.html"  > Chosen costumers how can get a benefit from improving the power factor of their installation. 
    "Logging_profailing.txt"    > Time and variables recording for the chosen methods or functions, it allows checking the
                                  performance of the code execution. 
    "CARTAS"  > Folder with the carts for each customer informing about the needed initial investment and the payback time for 
                each customer.



It is my first python code and I am aware that the code can be depurated and that It is a simplified example. for a real application, the calculations have to be done taking into account more variables and parameters.
